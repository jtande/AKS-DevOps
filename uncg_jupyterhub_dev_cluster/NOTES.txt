This are notes made in the course of configuring this
cluster as well as the jhub

1-     Additional storage volumes
If you already have a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim
created outside of JupyterHub you can mount them inside the user
pods. For example, if you have a shared PersistentVolumeClaim
called jupyterhub-shared-volume you could mount it as /home/shared
in all user pods: check link below for detail
https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customizing/user-storage.html

YAML for additional storage
singleuser:
  storage:
    extraVolumes:
      - name: jupyterhub-shared
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: jupyterhub-shared-volume
    extraVolumeMounts:
      - name: jupyterhub-shared
        mountPath: /home/shared
	
Note that if you want to mount a volume into multiple pods
the volume must support a suitable access mode at the link
